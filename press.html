            London-based band Cold In Berlin. Searing over the top of the heavy
            slabs of distorted guitar are Maya’s sweeping lyrics. The production
            of this album by Wayne Adams has managed to balance the dark
            brooding guitar and pounding beats with clear vocals so you can hear
            the foreboding dystopian descriptions.”</p>

Led by the sense shattering voice of Maya Berlin, she is the only crack in the dark - a vocally glinting blade in the gloom that slices silently through the air before making ears splinter for a ten mile radius. 
            That all this is achieved with a voice that never veers from a clarity that can initially take the breath away is possibly the biggest surprise. And yet, this lady is arguably the only link to the trashy post-punk that first started this band’s journey.
